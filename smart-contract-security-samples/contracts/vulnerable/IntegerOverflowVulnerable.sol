 * @title IntegerOverflowVulnerable
 * @notice Educational contract showing poor handling of balances and arithmetic (vulnerable design).
 * @dev This contract is intentionally insecure and compact for tutorial purposes.
 *
 * === WHAT'S WRONG / WHY IT'S VULNERABLE ===
 * - Anybody can mint tokens -> unlimited supply (economic attack).
 * - transfer subtracts without checking sender balance; on pre-0.8 compilers this would underflow silently.
 * - batchAdd has no per-item restrictions or caps and can corrupt totalSupply.
 * - No events/auditing and no ownership control on sensitive functions.
 *
 * NOTE: Solidity 0.8+ reverts on overflow/underflow, so some errors will revert here; the logic is still incorrect.
